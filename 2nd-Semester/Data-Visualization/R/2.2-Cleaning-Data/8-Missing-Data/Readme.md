## 1-Feature-Selection.R

### Code Breakdown

#### 1. **Loading the Dataset**

```r
data(msleep, package = "ggplot2")
```

- **`data(msleep, package = "ggplot2")`**: This line loads the `msleep` dataset from the `ggplot2` package into your R environment. The `msleep` dataset contains data about sleep patterns in mammals.

#### 2. **Calculating the Proportion of Missing Data**

```r
pctmiss <- colSums(is.na(msleep) / nrow(msleep))
```

- **`is.na(msleep)`**: This function returns a logical matrix indicating where `NA` (missing) values are in the `msleep` dataset. Each entry is `TRUE` if the value is missing and `FALSE` otherwise.
  
- **`colSums(is.na(msleep))`**: This function computes the sum of `TRUE` values (which represent missing values) for each column in the dataset. The result is a vector where each element represents the total number of missing values in a column.

- **`colSums(is.na(msleep)) / nrow(msleep)`**: This divides the number of missing values in each column by the total number of rows (`nrow(msleep)`) in the dataset. This calculation gives the proportion of missing values for each column.

- **`pctmiss`**: This variable holds the proportion of missing data for each column in the dataset.

#### 3. **Rounding and Displaying the Proportions**

```r
round(pctmiss, 2)
```

- **`round(pctmiss, 2)`**: This rounds the proportions of missing values to two decimal places for easier interpretation.

### Example Output

Let’s consider what the output might look like. The exact values depend on the dataset, but here’s a hypothetical example:

```r
# Example output
#       species        sleep_total        sleep_rem       sleep_cycle        awake
#        0.00                0.05                 0.10                0.02          0.00
```

### Explanation

- **`species`, `sleep_total`, `sleep_rem`, etc.**: These are column names from the `msleep` dataset.
- **`0.00`, `0.05`, `0.10`, etc.**: These numbers represent the proportion of missing data for each column. For instance, if `sleep_rem` has a proportion of `0.10`, it means that 10% of the values in the `sleep_rem` column are missing.

## 3-Imputation.R

The code snippet provided illustrates how to impute missing values in a dataset using the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) method. Let's break down the process and the key concepts involved:

### Imputing Missing Values with k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

#### 1. **Understanding the `kNN` Function**

```r
library(VIM)
newdata <- kNN(msleep, k=5)
```

- **`library(VIM)`**: The `VIM` package provides tools for visualizing and imputing missing data.
  
- **`kNN(msleep, k=5)`**: The `kNN` function from the `VIM` package is used to impute missing values based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Here's a breakdown of its parameters and functionality:
  - **`msleep`**: This is the dataset you are working with, which contains missing values.
  - **`k=5`**: Specifies that the algorithm should use the 5 nearest neighbors to impute missing values.

#### 2. **How kNN Imputation Works**

- **Selection of Neighbors**:
  - For each case (i.e., row) in the dataset with missing values, the algorithm identifies the `k` most similar cases (neighbors) that do not have missing values. Similarity is typically measured using distance metrics, such as Euclidean distance.

- **Imputation for Numeric Variables**:
  - If the missing value is numeric, the imputed value is the median of the values from the `k` nearest neighbors. The median is used to reduce the influence of outliers.

- **Imputation for Categorical Variables**:
  - If the missing value is categorical, the imputed value is the most frequent (mode) value among the `k` nearest neighbors. This approach ensures that the imputed value reflects the most common category within the neighborhood.

- **Iteration and Convergence**:
  - The imputation process iterates over cases and variables. It may involve multiple rounds of imputation until the results stabilize, meaning that the imputed values no longer change significantly with further iterations.

#### 3. **Detailed Explanation**

- **Missing Data**: 
  - In real datasets, some entries might be missing. These missing values can complicate analysis and modeling.
  
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Method**:
  - **Numerical Imputation**: By taking the median of the nearest neighbors, kNN ensures that the imputation is robust against outliers.
  - **Categorical Imputation**: By taking the mode of the nearest neighbors, kNN maintains the category distribution of the dataset.
  - **Convergence**: The iterative process ensures that the imputed values are stable and consistent with the data structure.

### Example of Imputation Process

Here’s an example illustrating the process conceptually:

1. **Dataset with Missing Values**:

   | id | feature1 | feature2 |
   |----|----------|----------|
   | 1  | 5        | NA       |
   | 2  | NA       | 3        |
   | 3  | 7        | 2        |
   | 4  | 6        | 4        |
   | 5  | 8        | NA       |

2. **Find Nearest Neighbors**:
   - For instance, to impute `feature2` for `id=1` (where `feature2` is missing), find the 5 most similar cases based on `feature1`.

3. **Impute Values**:
   - If `feature2` is numeric, compute the median of the `feature2` values from the nearest neighbors.
   - If `feature2` were categorical, compute the mode.

4. **Updated Dataset**:
   - After imputation, the dataset will no longer have missing values for the imputed features.

### Summary

- **kNN Imputation**: A method to fill in missing data by using information from the `k` nearest neighbors based on similarity.
- **Numeric Data**: Median of neighbors’ values is used.
- **Categorical Data**: Mode of neighbors’ values is used.
- **Iterative Process**: Ensures convergence and stability of imputed values.
