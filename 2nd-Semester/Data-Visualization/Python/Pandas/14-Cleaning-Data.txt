Data cleaning means fixing bad data in your data set.
Bad data could be:

    *Empty cells
    *Data in wrong format
    *Wrong data
    *Duplicates


The data set contains some empty cells ("Date" in row 22, and "Calories" in row 18 and 28).

The data set contains wrong format ("Date" in row 26).

The data set contains wrong data ("Duration" in row 7).

The data set contains duplicates (row 11 and 12).
