# My Academic Codes 🤓💻

Welcome to my GitHub repo where I upload all my academic code from university. Everything here is organized into folders semester-wise. It's basically a collection of practice, assignments, and other code stuff I did or I'm doing for university.

## 📂 Repo Breakdown

Here’s how things are organized:

### 📅 1st Semester

- **ANC**: Contains practice code for **C Programming**, **STL**, and general programming exercises.
- **Book**: Some extra problem solving from C Programming: A Modern Approach by K. N King.
- **KAZ**: Hands-on practice with **Makefile** and **gdb** (GNU Debugger).
- **misc**: Miscellaneous files, random experiments.

### 📅 2nd Semester

- **Data-Visualization**: Work related to data visualization in **Python**, **R**. 
- **OOP**: Object-Oriented Programming with Java.
- **LateX**: Sort of a template that includes necessary code for writing a documentation.

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools Used

Here's a quick summary of the programming languages and tools used across the projects:

- **C**: Used in 1st semester for assignments and programming exercises.
